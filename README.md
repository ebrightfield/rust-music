## An As-of-yet Unnamed Music Theory and Rendering Library

The intention of this library is to describe musical pitch sets
and other music theoretic constructs with their revelant information
that is entailed from the particular instances being constructed.

This library also intends to render objects into Lilypond source code,
for purposes of automated instructional document creation.

### Applications
- What sub- and super- chords exist within a given chord or scale?
- What are all the exhaustive ways to play a given chord on a given fretted instrument?
- What should I name a given set of notes? Are there other plausible names, assuming various other root notes?


### TODO
- Pitch struct, note + octave information
- Chord types as enums
- Library Error Type
- Various calculations of sub-/super-chords, whether something is intervallically symmetrical.
